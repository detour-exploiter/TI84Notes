2. Download the TI Connect CE software [https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw).
3. Drag the "TFILES.8xp" file onto your calculator in the TI Connect CE program.
4. Create a new text file (.txt), and add any notes to it.
5. Drag this text file over "ConvTextCMD.exe" so it says "Open with ConvTextCMD.exe" and drop it.
6. A new ".8xv" file should appear in the folder. Drag this onto your calculator in the TI Connect CE program.

It uses a slightly older program. You will only need to drag the "TFILES.8xp" file and any generated ".8xv" files into the TI Connect CE program.
